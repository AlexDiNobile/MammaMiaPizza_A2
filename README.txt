-----Overview of what you did?-----
Welcome to Mamma Mia's Pizzeria! For this assignment, I created a pizzeria where the player makes pizzas. The player uses buttons on a menu to add the toppings they want to a pizza, and after that, they click the pizza to send it to the oven where it cooks. Finally, they put the pizza in a pizza box and deliver it out the window to someone in the city beyond. 

To allow the player to make the pizza, I made all the toppings children of the pizza dough. The buttons change the visibility of the toppings on the pizza. In order to create the movement and cooking effects, I used animations that altered the appearance and position of the pizza dough, cheese and sauce. Once the player is done and the pizza is put in the box and delivered, the player can spawn a new pizza dough to work on and start the cycle again. This allows all the same items to be reused simply by resetting their appearance and location.

All the interactable items in the experience have some auditory or visual feedback to tell the player that what they are doing is having an effect. I also designed the environment to appear like a pizza shop in a snowy city to help the player feel immersed.

Finally, to allow the game to be used on mobile, I created teleportation pads that will appear on load if the window size is smaller than 900 pixels. The player needs to move their phone around to change the view. This allows the player to move and look around without using a mouse and keyboard if they are on a phone.

-----What was challenging?-----
There wasn't much that was very challenging about this project. I have quite a lot of experience with HTML and JavaScript, and what we learned in class was very useful in setting me on the right track. That being said, the most challenging part was figuring out how to use A-Frame elements in conjunction with JavaScript to change their elements; this was particularly challenging when creating the teleportation pads and using animations in JavaScript to change the appearance of the cooking pizza.

-----What went well?-----
For the most part, everything went very well. I had very few challenges and enjoyed experimenting with what was possible in A-Frame. The few challenges I encountered were easy to work around using A-Frame documentation and other online resources that were very easy to find and informative. Even with anything I couldn't find documentation on, I could still solve myself using trial and error and the coding principles I have gained.
